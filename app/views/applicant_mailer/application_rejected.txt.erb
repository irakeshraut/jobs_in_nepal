Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

It appears your application for <%= @job.title %> advertised by <%= @job.user.company.name %> is unlikely to progress further.

Each employer or recuriter has their own process so you may or may not hear back from them. Keep track of all your applied jobs on your <%= link_to 'Applied Jobs', applied_jobs_user_url(@user) %> page.

Here is the job you've applied on <%= @applicant.created_at.strftime("%d/%m/%Y") %>

Job Title: <%= link_to @job.title, @job %>
Company Name: <%= @job.user.company.name %>
Company Location: <%= @job.location %>
